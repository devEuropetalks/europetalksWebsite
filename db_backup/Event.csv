"cm5bzy9je0000me03ogucns48","Migration and EU Asylum Policy","Our weekend in Madrid started on Friday evening with a panel discussion with former and current Members of the European Parliament as well as one representative of an organisation for refugees. The atmosphere in the room was great – not only thanks to a friendly welcome of our Spanish hosts but also because of the lively debates between the participants about Europe and our views on migration.

All the speakers had one thought in common: migration policy must be based on human rights and the values of the European Union. In the subsequent discussion with the audience, other topics such as the increasingly strengthening of right-wing populism in the European Union were addressed. This panel discussion as well as the debate with the audience provided a successful start for our workshops that started the next morning.

On Saturday morning we started our first workshop on Asylum and Refugees – Solutions to Human Rights and Foreign Affairs Policies. After a short introduction, the individual positions of the various organizations started. Firstly, the European delegations presented their views. Then our comrade from Chad described his perspective on the subject. In our discussions, we agreed on many points. First and foremost, it immediately became clear that the criminalization of the non-profit sea rescue must be tackled. In addition, we quickly agreed on the demands for a better intra-European cooperation.At noon, all EuropeTalks-participants joined our Spanish comrades at the PSOE party conference. After some captivating speeches, we had the chance to meet Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. We witnessed how social democracy is currently flourishing in Spain and how the country can serve as a role model for other member states in the European Union.

While the workshop in the morning covered a wide range of topics, the second workshop Borders and Neighborhood – Developing Frontex and International Cooperation focused in particular on border protection. Our basic understanding was the same: the current situation at the borders of the European Union must change fundamentally – and this must start with Frontex. Together we developed a proposal on how border controls can be made more appropriate and, above all, more humane. This could, for instance, be achieved through parliamentary control and by hiring additional specialists, from lawyers to social workers.

With our last workshop we looked specifically across European borders and discussed Africa and the Middle East – Development Policies. We discussed how our understanding of development cooperation must be fundamentally expanded and redesigned. Possible solutions included practical approaches both in our partner countries, such as joint venture programs in the field of technology transfer, but also here in the EU, among others, an improved education and critical reflection on European imperialism and colonialism.

On Sunday, we used the previous day’s workshops to draw up a position paper with our common assessments and demands. The summary of our workshop results on the topic of migration and EU asylum policy was then passed on and distributed in all EuropeTalks delegations.","2018-11-08 23:00:00","2018-11-11 22:59:59.999","Madrid","https://utfs.io/f/2FFR0jlifdHq6WjSHe2B9m0upJMK3ZN7coiHRqUFf8v2PWzy","[object Object]","2024-12-31 04:57:14.954","2024-12-31 04:57:14.954"

What is the European Green Deal’s focus?
Which issues need to be considered?
How do the member countries view the deal and what are the main focuses?

EuropeTalks is characterised by the fact that we connect the regional levels with each other and thus spread the European idea.
Our Croatian members, in close cooperation with FES Croatia, have now successfully launched this process.
In three online meetings, due to Corona, the participants discussed the effects of the Green Deal on local politics, the functioning of a plastic-free recycling economy and, most recently, in a brainstorming meeting on possible measures.
In particular, we would like to thank Tonino Picula, MEP, and Ivana Kordic, President of the NGO Tatavka as speakers at the first two online meetings, as well as FES Croatia for their close and reliable cooperation.
You will find the results and our political demands as soon as they are available on our website under documents.","2020-04-01 12:14:00","2020-05-31 21:59:59.999","Croatia","https://utfs.io/f/2FFR0jlifdHqAJBpvFeryVkpJCGf5sSEvcTPbq8tQ14FUZg3","[object Object]","2024-12-31 13:15:22.393","2024-12-31 13:15:22.393"

It is clear that Europe needs an update. But in what way, and in which areas? In order to provide a platform for these debates to young social democrats from all over Europe, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung EU Office and EuropeTalks created this new interactive online series.

On 1 July, we launched our first event. Together with MEP Klára Dobrev, Vice President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, German MP and former President of the European Parliament, and viewers from all over Europe, we focussed on a topic that had become very important in the previous months: solidarity in Europe.

A poll at the beginning of the event revealed that there were indeed a lot of social democrats participating: almost half of the viewership stated that the key aspect for a stable European Union is a common EU social policy. Although Klára agreed with the importance of a common social policy, she did not want to choose between the different options of the poll, choosing instead all of them. She explained that a close European cooperation, possibly in the form of a United States of Europe, is a historical necessity and a political imperative for us all. She pointed out that the EU is at a crucial moment right now and that the decisions made now, for example on a common debt policy, are set to be featured in future history books. Martin agreed, and by referring to the temporary closure of inner-European borders he added that we need to protect already existing cornerstones of European integration such as free movement for all.

Prior to the event, we had sent packages with items to both Klára and Martin that they unpacked live during the event. The items were related to our debate, Klára for example received a face mask and a flight ticket for a European flight during the lockdown-week. The items both inspired her to make several associations. For her, the face mask symbolized the current debates about the COVID-19 recovery fund and the idea of a health union in Europe, but also the state of care workers who are often forgotten about despite fulfilling essential tasks both before and during the crisis. Martin received a part of a fence as one of the items, associating it with restrictive migration policies in general and with the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán in particular. He emphasized that Progressives all around Europe should support the democratic opposition and civil society in Hungary and in all other countries where liberal democracies are at stake.

In the following open discussion, participants and EuropeTalks activists from all around Europe asked questions concerning the deepening split between Northern and Southern Europe in the course of the COVID-crisis, the state of women’s and minorities rights and the concrete further development of a European welfare state. The discussion revealed that the European Union and its member states need to be more cooperative and provide support for local communities and cities with a focus on the regions and countries most effected by the COVID-19 related economic decline and the approaching Brexit.

We really enjoyed the event and are glad to have received so much positive feedback from you all!

What is the situation regarding the European and global distribution of the Covid vaccine and how does the EU support developing countries in the course of the pandemic? What exactly is the EU Recovery Fund? And how are transatlantic relations progressing after the Trump administration? 

Together with Margarida Marques, former secretary of state for European affairs in Portugal and now S&D member of the European Parliament, these and other questions were addressed. It was hosted and moderated at a very interactive level by Vivien Costanzo (EuropeTalks), Agnes Mach (FES Brussels) and Alexia Feick (EuropeTalks).  Emphasis was hugely placed on how Portugal is positioning itself as EU Council President.

While the megatrend comes with potential for societal progress, it also brings along challenges that need to be addressed. As digitalisation does not stop at borders, it is inherently a European or even global matter. The current EU Commission has made digitalisation one of its key priorities. But what exactly are its plans to regulate Big Tech and the internet as we know it? And why is there such a debate around Artificial Intelligence and the creation of rules for its use?

Together with Tiemo Wölken, MEP for the S&D, and Sara Chandler, Senior Policy Adviser at the Digital Rights NGO EDRi, we talked about ongoing efforts of the European Commission.

As a first thematic block, we discussed approaches to regulate the internet. Tiemo Wölken, Shadow Negotiator for the Digital Services Act, was able to provide first-hand insights into the current plans of the European Commission. EuropeTalks activist Miguel contributed a highly debated question on the role of Big Tech and what a European regulatory response to their market power could be.

In a second thematic block, the discussion focused on the impact of artificial intelligence on society and European approaches to regulate it. Sarah Chandler, expert for Artificial Intelligence and non-discrimination in the digital space, introduced us to a variety of risks connected to the use of AI, e.g. when using facial recognition technology.

 Our Spanish friends have travelled to Frankfurt and the surrounding area for supporting the SPD, the local candidates and Olaf Scholz.

In Frankfurt they campaigned with Armand Zorn and Kaweh Mansoori, in Wiesbaden with Nadine Ruf, in Hanau with Lennard Oehl, in Bad Homburg for Alicia Bokler, and Darmstadt and surrounding are with Andreas Larem and Jens Zimmermann.There was positive feedback on the streets by many people.

European solidarity in times of the Corona pandemic was one of the main topics on the agenda throughout the three-day-event. The impact of the COVID-Virus in Spain, as in many other member states, were severe. The Congress was a welcome opportunity to start a European debate between social democrats form different member states about how to deal with those impacts as a European society and where to go from here.

Besides the pandemic, the Russian-Ukraine conflict as well as the new german government were just two of various other topics to be discussed in Madrid. The event was a great example of how a European debate can be fostered and a common European idea can be spread on a local level.

This was a also special event as the chairman of the last few years and one of our own – Javi Guardiola – did not run again as chairman of the JSM. We are expressing our thanks to Javi for his support over the last years and his efforts to strengthen social democracy as an european idea not only within the JSM, but also beyond national borders.

On Thursday, founder of EuropeTalks Vivien Costanzo was invited to the FES Zagreb Summer School in Lovran, where she was part of the opening speeches and the following panel discussion.

We had the chance to enter the building of the City Council of Rijeka, where our beloved Adelina showed us the plenary sessions’ room and explained to us the most important details of Rijeka’s political, social and cultural landscape. Next, we met at the SDP office, where we planned Saturday’s routine. But the work did not end up there, as later we presented our country reports and started planning Beer&Roses.

Did you know that 561 steps lead to the historical center of Trsat? We discovered it on Saturday, when we stayed the Shrine of Our Lady of Trsat, a sanctuary visited by Pope John Paul II in 2003, and Trsat Castle, with amazing views and full of historical facts. It was really worth it.

We celebrated our big event, Beer&Roses, where we reunited activists and politicians from different countries and discussed current topics, such as Croatian entering the Eurozone and youth engagement in politics.

Also under discussion ,was the concept of European solidarity with Ukraine ,and what Ukrainains expected from their fellow Europeans.

Alongside this discussion , EuropeTalks also organised a “ World Cafe “ event , where the collective of Europe Talks activists presented on topics ranging from doorstep campaigning , to dismantling Fortress Europe and the current gas crisis , providing an opportunity to network and exchange information with PES Activists from across Europe. The event proved fruitful on both sides, with both the EuropeTalks activists and PES Activists finding common ground and solutions to take forward in regard to some of the most prominent issues facing Europe today.

In the run-up to the congress, we had the opportunity to talk to activists from the West Bank and Gaza about the current situation. It is important for us to look beyond the European horizon. Many thanks to the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung East Jerusalem for making this possible!

This event led to an intercultural exchange between 30+ participants from 8 countries. We had the opportunity to talk with german special guest Member of Parliament Andreas Larem and listened to several speeches from Kyrgyz politicians. It was interesting to visit the American University of Central Asia and learn about their way of establishing climate efficient solutions. Also we had the chance to talk with several activists about climate and urban challenges of Kyrgyzstan.

After a delightful Beer&Roses-event in Bishkek we concluded this special and eventful week with a trip to Issyk-kul, where we gathered in workshops from IDEA CA about debating and had many instructive discussions, while sharing the perspectives from different countries and continents.

We are thankful for building relations to such inspiring people from Central Asia. Special thanks to FES Kyrgyzstan for having us!","2023-05-28 22:00:00","2023-06-04 21:59:59.999","Kyrgyzstan","https://utfs.io/f/2FFR0jlifdHqHJqiNLREIXjws7kURorGJ0KBWyc2alhv1AZq","[object Object]","2024-12-31 13:57:45.631","2024-12-31 13:57:45.631"
"cm5cjagf70008kv03cdtcyte1","Annual Conference:  Reception","To celebrate our fifth anniversary in style, we held a reception at the European Parliamentary Association, where we welcomed many MEPs, activists and friends.

There were also many friends from the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung who have been supporting and facilitating our projects for some time. We looked back with gratitude on our origins and the path we have taken together since then.

We had the great honor of welcoming the Vice President of the EU Parliament, Katarina Barley. In her moving speech, she emphasized the importance of the European Parliament as a stronghold against the rising far-right forces in Europe and encouraged us in our commitment to social democracy in Europe.

Afterwards we could feel the spirit of EuropeTalks, got into conversation with each other and made new contacts. Many thanks to everyone who made this evening unforgettable!","2023-09-13 18:00:00","2023-09-13 18:00:00","European Parliamentary Association, Strasbourg","https://utfs.io/f/2FFR0jlifdHqePyhOifOHgskLNY9l6AKuM4Rd5XU7I1FZf8P","[object Object]","2024-12-31 13:58:36.446","2024-12-31 13:58:36.446"

The Annual Conference was therefore a very special occasion to meet familiar and new faces. At the European Parliament in Strasbourg, we exchanged views with René Repasi, MEP from Germany, on the current political situation and the negotiations in which he is involved. 

The highlight was certainly the reception for the anniversary of EuropeTalks with many friends and companions. The future of EuropeTalks and our next projects were also discussed – stay tuned!

In between, there was time for the thirty activists from 14 countries to network, talk about the political situation in their countries and focus on next year’s European elections.

Many thanks also to the FES Europe Office and Ingmar Naumann, who took wonderful care of us. 

We are looking forward to the next five years!","2023-09-12 22:00:00","2023-09-17 21:59:59.999","Strasbourg","https://utfs.io/f/2FFR0jlifdHqMIzOmat7piJyAvDrzcwP4ZnsjgHxMbYVISR8","[object Object]","2024-12-31 13:59:26.003","2024-12-31 13:59:26.003"
