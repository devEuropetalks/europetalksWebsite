        "mission": "Our main goal is to provide a platform for European democrats, to connect like-minded people from all over Europe and beyond and to work together for a common European vision, based on social democratic and socialist values. We want to enable people to share their values and visions on how to further develop and shape the European Union."

        "conference": "It all started after the \"Europe, we need to talk!\" – conference in 2018, which was organized by the Jusos and SPD Hessen-Süd in Germany. This was supported by Udo Bullmann, MEP and Michael Roth, German Minister Of State For Europe In The Foreign Ministry.",
        "activists": "Activists from all over Europe were invited to talk about common issues like social inequality across member states as well as our European identity. We looked for collaborations and inspirations to find answers to the problems and challenges we face all over Europe. At the conference we all saw the need to keep on working together on these issues and many more – direct and without intermediary – as a European grassroot movement. At the end of our kick-off event, a resolution was adopted in the manifesto \"Europe, we need to talk\", which serves as the basis for further cooperation and common policy making.",
        "perspective": "We usually discuss Europe in our parties from a national perspective. We want to establish a European perspective. Every local party and political committee can create an exchange through social democratic and socialist partner organizations. This can be achieved through local exchange projects, digital networking and much more. We link every regional group on a long-term and sustainable basis in order make sure Europe is at the centre of in our daily party work.",
        "countries": "We are a group of activists from 14 different countries: Spain, France, Lithuania, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Poland, Italy, Croatia, Ukraine, Austria, Latvia as well as the UK. But we are always looking for new activists from all over Europe and beyond. Are you interested? Just get in touch with us."

        "title": "How We Work",
        "intro": "We, as Socialists and Social Democrats, must embody the European idea and create European networks at every level. Only then can European policies be credibly represented and promoted.",
        "method": "We make this happen by connecting people in every local organization. In order to support individuals to understand different point of views, to share political experiences, and to work together on solutions to common issues we organize workshops and events – both online and in person.",
        "workshops": "Our workshops tackle specific issues and offer the possibility to exchange ideas and find solutions to common European problems. How can we better deal with migration and refugees in the European Union in a humane way? What can we do to make housing affordable and sustainable? What would a socialist international security policy look like?",
        "papers": "These workshops form the basis for our joint work and our positioning in terms of specific policy issues. At the end of each workshop, we draw up discussion papers, which are carried into the individual organizations and which are intended to contribute to the formation of policy in these organizations. This is the only way we can ensure that European issues are included in the debate and discussed with a real European perspective.",
        "support": "We also support local party organisations to connect each other. Are you part of a local committee and need support in building a European network? Then write to us!"
