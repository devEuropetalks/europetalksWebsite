Hi,

hope you're doing well! 😊
I have made some small changes and improvements to the website and cloud and would now please ask you again - if possible to check the translations if you have time. 🙏
Unused translations have been removed and the editing flow has been improved.
You can now also use the same login details you use on the website when logging into the cloud. Just use the Login with Europetalks Auth button if promted.
Logged in, please create a New Folder with the + Button in the top right, give the folder your Name so we know who uploaded the images and then upload the images and Videos.

_Important Note: This Login Method only works for the Browser and doesn't seem to work for the mobile Nextcloud App._
